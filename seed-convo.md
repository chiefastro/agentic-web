I'm an NLP data scientist / AI engineer with entrepreneurship experience. Help me find an AI startup idea that's actually worth leaving my job for.
I'm bullish about browser extensions. Also interesed in the future of the agentic web, like what Tollbit and Cloudflare are working on (micropayments for content providers). One hunch I have is that e-commerce and other transactional web sites will have the opposite economics of content providers - instead of setting up paywalls for agents, they will want to pay agents to come (kind of like an ad). Could that have legs? Is there a wedge somewhere in that stack?

# GPT-5 Thinking
Short answer: yes, it has legs—and your wedge is to build the agent-native version of affiliate/performance marketing, starting with Shopify/DTC where merchants are eager to let agents transact (vs. Big Marketplaces that are blocking them).

Why this is real (signals)
	•	Content side is going paywalled for bots (Cloudflare Pay-Per-Crawl + signed “verified bots”), which strengthens the counter-trend: commerce sites will pay to acquire agent traffic.  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Big marketplaces are resisting third-party agents (e.g., Amazon actively blocking LLM agents), which creates a huge long-tail/DTC opportunity for agent-friendly checkout.  ￼
	•	Agentic checkout infra is emerging right now (Bold Commerce agentic endpoints; Shopify “agents” APIs for catalog/universal cart). That’s your rails.  ￼ ￼
	•	Affiliate economics already fund “pay the intermediary”—a $17–$21B market that today runs on brittle last-click cookies and extensions that creators/brands hate. Agents can do it better (cookieless, signed, transparent).  ￼ ￼
	•	The browser battleground is heating up (agentic browsers, extensions). You like this surface; so do I.  ￼

The wedge: an Agent Bounties Network (ABN)

Think “reverse paywall for agents.”
Merchants post bounties (CPA/CPL/CPO) for agent-driven actions; your browser extension + API routes user/agent intent to bounty-friendly merchants and executes a signed, policy-compliant checkout.

Key primitives
	1.	Agent Authentication: adopt HTTP Message Signatures (Cloudflare Verified Bots model) so merchants can positively identify compliant agents—no stealth crawling, no cookie jacking.  ￼
	2.	Cookieless Attribution: server-to-server postbacks/webhooks (the “Impact.com way”) instead of last-click cookies; tie to order IDs and Bold/Shopify webhooks.  ￼
	3.	Offer/Bounty Catalog: merchants publish JSON offers (trigger = “add_to_cart | checkout_complete | new_subscriber”). Agents discover & price-compare including bounty share-back to the user.
	4.	Agent-Safe Checkout: integrate Bold Agentic Checkout and Shopify’s new universal cart/checkout kit so merchants keep tax, promos, fraud, and OMS logic—agents just drive the flow.  ￼ ￼
	5.	Fair Attribution & Disclosure: the extension surfaces “this purchase pays your agent $X (you keep Y%).” Align with FTC Endorsement rules and EU transparency norms out of the box.  ￼ ￼

Why this beats coupon extensions
	•	Coupon/“last-click” extensions are under fire for commission hijacking; merchants and creators want a cleaner channel. Your signed, server-verified flow fixes the trust layer.  ￼ ￼

Where to start (focus)
	•	Vertical: Shopify/DTC brands in categories with clear intent → supplements, running shoes, pet care (fast AOVs, frequent repeat).
	•	Supply: 30–50 merchants via a “Agent-Friendly Merchant” badge + SDK (1-line script to publish offers and enable postbacks).
	•	Demand: your browser extension that: (a) brokers offers to users/agents at decision time, (b) executes checkout via Bold/Shopify endpoints, (c) pays the user a cut automatically.

90-day punch list
	•	Week 1–2: 15 merchant interviews; spec the Offer JSON + postback schema; draft FTC/DSA-aligned disclosures.  ￼ ￼
	•	Week 3–6: Build extension MVP (intent capture, offer selection UI, signed agent identity), merchant SDK, and Bold/Shopify checkout path.  ￼ ￼
	•	Week 7–10: Pilot with 5–10 merchants; measure CR uplift vs. baseline affiliate; user rev-share take-rate.
	•	Week 11–12: Launch “Agent-Friendly” directory + case studies; open the API to third-party agents.

If you want, I’ll sketch the Offer JSON, the postback/receipt verification flow, and the extension UX next.

# Jared
We're on to something here. I drew up a diagram of the Agentic Commerce Ecosystem that I think will take shape over the coming years. Let's convert my hand-drawn diagram into a digital version that I can manipulate with a UI or code (maybe mermaid, maybe a file format for drawio or something equivalent).
I next want to create a similar diagram for the Agentic Content Ecosystem. That's the portion of the web where the economics are reversed - content publishers want to charge consumers money instead of offer bounties. Tollbit, Cloudflare, etc. have built the rails there, and Perplexity, Google, ChatGPT, etc. have built the consumer agents that consume content and need to adopt usage-based pricing to pass on those content fees to end users (via Tollbit, Cloudflare, etc.).
I then want to write a white paper describing the Agentic Web, which will combine both sides of the web (paywallers and bounty offerers). The white paper should include the diagrams created in the first two steps.
There are business opportunities all throughout this new Agentic Web. I intend to found a startup that implements the Global Offer Registry for the Agentic Commerce Ecosystem. This startup will define standards and protocols (via the white paper) and create products on top of the core search index of offers for each stage in the ecosystem, but with extensibility and 3rd-party versions in mind for each. For example, the startup will publish a browser extension that will serve as a first-party consumer agent, but the protocols will also enable ChatGPT, Comet, etc. to act as those consumer agents that end up the protocol/standards rails and core search index built by the startup. In other words, architect an ecosystem with protocols and standards that can be adopted across an industry, then be the first mover to build out products that use those open standards.

Agentic Web: A Two-Sided Protocol for Commerce Bounties and Content Paywalls

Version: 0.1 (draft)

⸻

Abstract

A proposal for an open, interoperable Agentic Web where autonomous agents transact with publishers and merchants under two mirrored economics: (1) Agentic Commerce, where merchants compete for agent-driven transactions with bounties, and (2) Agentic Content, where publishers charge usage-based access via standardized metering rails. We specify identity, offer/price registries, metering, attribution, and settlement protocols; and outline a reference implementation for a Global Offer Registry (GOR).

1. Motivation & Background
	•	Rise of AI-native browsers and agentic workflows.
	•	Publisher economics (paywalls, per-request pricing) versus merchant economics (acquisition bounties).
	•	Need for verifiable agent identity, transparent attribution, and cookieless settlement.

2. Core Design Principles
	•	Protocols over platforms, composability, minimal trust.
	•	Verifiable agent identity and consentful access.
	•	Cookieless attribution and server-to-server receipts.
	•	Interchangeable rails (multiple providers can implement each role).

3. Part I — Agentic Commerce Ecosystem

Figure 1: Agentic Commerce Diagram (Mermaid)

Placeholder for diagram: /mnt/data/agentic_commerce.mmd

3.1 Roles
	•	Merchant, Offer Publisher, Sales Associate Agent, Global Offer Registry (GOR), Semantic Layer, Transaction Layer, Consumer Agent, User Wallet, Merchant Wallet, Payment Issuer (e.g., single-use card).

3.2 Protocols & Artifacts
	•	Offer Document (JSON): terms, triggers, reward schedule, postback endpoints, proof-of-reserve.
	•	Attribution Receipt: order_id, agent_id, signature, timestamp, bounty locked.
	•	Settlement Postback: success, amount, split schedule (user/agent/associate).
	•	A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Envelope: signed claims (agent_id, capabilities, policies).
	•	MCP Usage: capability discovery and task invocation across agents.

3.3 Flows
	1.	Offer publication → Registry indexing → Discovery → Presentation → Acceptance.
	2.	Checkout (intent → auth → order submit → status) with cookieless attribution.
	3.	Bounty reserve → Purchase success → Settlement → Payout to User/Agent.

3.4 Reference Implementation
	•	Global Offer Registry (search + provenance), Semantic mapping, Transaction service (escrow, postbacks), Browser extension (first-party consumer agent).

4. Part II — Agentic Content Ecosystem

Figure 2: Agentic Content Diagram (Mermaid)

Placeholder for diagram: /mnt/data/agentic_content.mmd

4.1 Roles
	•	Publisher, Paywall/Metering Rails (e.g., Tollbit, Cloudflare), Price/Policy Registry, Metering/Reporting, Settlement, Consumer Agent, User Wallet.

4.2 Protocols & Artifacts
	•	Price Quote Document: content_id, price model (per-token/req/time), policy, signature, expiration.
	•	Verified Agent Token: signed agent identity + policy conformance.
	•	Usage Events: metered units with nonces and proof-of-processing.
	•	Invoice & Settlement: periodic billing, payment channel debits/credits.

4.3 Flows
	1.	Quote → Present → Accept.
	2.	Verified access → Content stream → Usage metering → Settlement.

5. Interop Between the Two Sides
	•	Shared identity layer, shared wallets, unified user consent & spend controls.
	•	Cross-ledger accounting (bounty income can offset content spend).
	•	Privacy: minimal data required, receipts rather than raw logs.

6. Standards Roadmap
	•	V0: Offer JSON + Postbacks, Quote JSON + Usage Events, Receipt signatures.
	•	V1: A2A envelope + MCP profile.
	•	V2: Decentralized registry discovery (signed feeds), portable reputations.

7. Security & Compliance
	•	Agent verification, anti-fraud, FTC disclosures, EU consumer transparency.
	•	Regulated payments handling, refunds/chargebacks, disputes.

8. Business Model & Ecosystem Strategy
	•	Open standards to grow the pie; first-party products (extension, registry, transaction services) to capture value.
	•	Marketplace + analytics + premium tooling.

9. Implementation Plan
	•	Pilot vertical (Shopify/DTC) for commerce, selected publishers for content.
	•	SDKs for merchants/publishers, receipts test harness, reference extension.

10. Next Steps
	•	Finalize Offer/Quote schemas, postback/usage events.
	•	Run partner interviews; publish v0 spec; launch private beta of GOR.
